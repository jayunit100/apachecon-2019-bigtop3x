Zookeeper requires a persistentVolumeClaim, and the helm chart isn't editable after install becase
statefulsets are immutable. 

So, install a hostpath-provisioner or nfs provisioner via helm for this particular example.

```
helm upgrade --install hostpath-provisioner --namespace kube-system rimusz/hostpath-provisioner
```

Alternatively, you can manually provision hostpath volumes as shown in the YAML file.

Greate work by cetic getting Nifi helmified ! Other then the statefulset issue for ZK, it works
great...
 
```
helm repo add cetic https://cetic.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```
